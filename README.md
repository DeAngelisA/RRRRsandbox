# RRRRsandbox
Sandbox environment for the RRRR workshop. 

## Instructions

Set up a GitHub repo mirroring the messy_project. 

- Create an issue with the improvement you want to make
- Make your improvements to the project folder and then commit (practice with the pull-commit-push loop)
- Open a pull request and nominate someone and me as reviewers. @notify us also in the issue. 
- If everything looks good, we will merge your branch and close it.
